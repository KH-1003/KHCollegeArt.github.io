				<tr>
					<td><img src="shell.png" width="400" height="300" style="margin-left:-80px; border: 10px solid #78726E;" alt="Shell"/>
					</td>
					<td><h1 style="margin-right:300px; margin-top:20px;">Seashell</h1><p style="margin-left:110px; margin-top:10px;">This seashell is a representation of myself when I left home for college.
						I had felt like a defeated version of myself desperately needing a place to grow and learn how to be an adult without the supervision of my parents. 
						While the seashell has permanently carved edges that will never regrow, I believe that the shine within leads to growth and the knowledge to be better for myself and for others.</p></td>

					<td><img src="KHinton09 2.jpg" width="300" height="425" style="margin-left:-80px; margin-top:50px; border: 10px solid #78726E;" alt="Movie Poster"/>
					</td>
					<td><h1 style="margin-left:70px; margin-top:50px;">Hidden Figures</h1><p style="margin-left:110px; margin-top:10px;">For this movie poster I wanted to pull important ideas and items to 
						cohesively describe what Hidden Figures is about. The color of the background is reminiscent of a chalk board while featuring different mathematical equations from the movie, including the method that led to
						the successful rocket launch. The magnifying glass represents the search throughout the movie to find that method to accurately plan and execute the launch. The rocket in the background is to reference the overall
					idea of the movie, to successfully launch a rocket into space with a man inside</p>

				<tr>
					<td><img src="Nevermore.jpg" width="300" height="425" style="margin-left:-80px; margin-top:50px; border:10px solid #78726E;" alt="Nevermore"/></td>
					<td><h1 style="margin-left:70px; margin-top:-15px;">Return of Nevermore</h1><p style="margin-left:110px; margin-top:10px;">Return of Nevermore is about the return of the feeling of despair from another loss. 
						It utilizes a raven to reference a memento mori and Edgar Allen Poe's The Raven. It is to represent how people recieve more flowers when they are not longer alive than when they were alive. 
						Bring the reminder of death, guilt, and despair back to the viewer.</p></td>
